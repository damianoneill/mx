Sample application for demonstration C# code that satisfies the Digital Development - Building a Solution module for CCEA Digital Technology.

A presentation exists to describe the code, three versions are available;

* [Powerpoint Version](./docs/docs/Digital-Development-Building-A-Solution.pptx)
* [Keynote Version](./docs/Digital-Development-Building-A-Solution.key)
* [PDF Version](./docs/Digital-Development-Building-A-Solution.pdf) - this does not contain the presenter notes.

_NOTE_ The code is not intended to be 'clean', it is designed to teach data types, control structures, functions, data structures and logical and relational operators.  The code is not in way optimized, there is intended redundancy and repetition.

Solution uses the .NET SDK to build and run the application.

```sh
$ dotnet run 
What is your name? Damian
Hello Damian!
```

At each stage where new functionality is introduced a Git Tag has been created, these are ordered numerically.
